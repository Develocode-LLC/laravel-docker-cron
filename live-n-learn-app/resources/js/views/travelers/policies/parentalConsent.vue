              treatment for me and transporting me to the United States all at my

              through my group leader written behavior guidelines and regulations

              Learn cannot accept responsibility for travelers not following these
              rules and regulations, and that I may be sent home at my own expense

              behavior guidelines and standards and the instructions of my group
              leader. I understand that if I am expelled from school or otherwise
              disciplined by school or civic authorities, I may be declared
              ineligible for the trip and my participation canceled, subject to

              local consular offices of the countries I will be visiting to obtain
              the necessary visas. Such visas are not obtainable on the spot
              overseas. Whether I am a U.S. citizen or not, Live N Learn will be

              issues an official Travel Warning that Americans should not travel to any country visited on the itinerary
              and 3) the official Travel Warning is issued or in effect within 90 days prior to departure. In such

              cancellation insurance coverage, I may withdraw and receive from a 75% refund less ELITE insurance fee and
              any visa fees, or after the trip has already commenced, I may withdraw and Live N Learn will provide the
              cost of a return flight to the U.S. city of departure up to the limit provided without refund of any other
